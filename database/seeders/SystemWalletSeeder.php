 * Creates the two admin-controlled system wallets:
 *   - Primary Escrow  (receives platform fees)
 *   - SyCash          (holds passenger escrow funds)
 *
 * These wallets have no user_id — they belong to the platform, not a person.
 * WalletTransactionService resolves them by phone number from config/admin.php.
 *
 * Uses firstOrCreate so re-seeding never duplicates wallets or resets balances.
