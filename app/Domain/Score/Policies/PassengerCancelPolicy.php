/**
 * Passenger Cancel Policy
 *
 * Scoring grid (passenger, cancel seat(s)):
 *
 *  Elapsed     | normal          | high cancel rate
 *  0–30 %      |   0 pts         |    −10 pts
 *  30–50 %     |  −5 pts         |    −10 pts
 *  50–100 %    | −10 pts         |    −10 pts
 *
 * High cancel rate override activates when:
 *   - total_cancellations >= MIN_CANCELLATIONS (3), AND
 *   - cancel_rate > HIGH_RATE_THRESHOLD (50 %)
 *
 * The cancellation count gate prevents penalising new passengers on their
 * first cancellations before a meaningful rate can be established.
 * Base tier penalties (−5, −10) always apply even without the override.
