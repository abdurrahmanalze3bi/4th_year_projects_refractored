/**
 * Driver Cancel Ride Policy
 *
 * Scoring grid (driver, cancel whole ride):
 *
 *  Elapsed     | normal          | high cancel rate
 *  0–30 %      |   0 pts         |    −15 pts
 *  30–50 %     |  −7 pts         |    −15 pts
 *  50–100 %    | −12 pts         |    −15 pts
 *
 * High cancel rate override activates when:
 *   - total_cancellations >= MIN_CANCELLATIONS (3), AND
 *   - cancel_rate >= HIGH_RATE_THRESHOLD (50 %)
 *
 * The cancellation count gate prevents penalising new drivers on their
 * first cancellations before a meaningful rate can be established.
 * Base tier penalties (−7, −12) always apply even without the override.
